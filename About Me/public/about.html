  <h1>Khangembam Alex D Nelson</h1>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dedicated Computer Science and Engineering graduate with hands-on experience in a variety of programming languages,<br /> including C, C++, Java, Kotlin, Python, and web development with HTML and CSS. 
  I have a passion for problem-solving <br /> and software development, as demonstrated through my development of a Java-based Tic-Tac-Toe game and deep learning projects,<br /> such as using EfficientNet-B2 and GANs to eliminate steganographic content in images. 
  My expertise extends to backend frameworks<br /> like Django, and Iâ€™m constantly seeking new challenges to further enhance my technical skills.
  Alongside my technical abilities,<br/> I also have a creative side, expressed through photography.</p>
