    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify-self: unset;;">
    A dedicated Computer Science and Engineering graduate with hands-on experience in a variety of programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Kotlin, Python, and web development with HTML and CSS. 
    I have a passion for problem-solving and software development, as demonstrated through my development of a Java-based Tic-Tac-Toe game and deep learning projects, such as using EfficientNet-B2 and GANs to eliminate steganographic content in images. 
    My expertise extends to backend frameworks like Django, and I’m constantly seeking new challenges to further enhance my technical skills.
    Alongside my technical abilities, I also have a creative side, expressed through photography.
